🔧 Setup (toy example)

Let’s say the theoretical OSNR threshold for a certain modulation format is
T = 21 \text{ dB}.

You have five lightpaths with predicted OSNR (point) and their conformal bands (in dB):

Sample	True OSNR	Predicted (ŷ)	Lower (L)	Upper (U)	Comment
1	22.5	22.8	22.4	23.0	Entire band well above 21 ✅
2	20.5	20.8	20.6	21.2	Band crosses 21 (borderline) ⚠️
3	19.5	19.6	19.3	19.9	Entirely below 21 ❌
4	21.1	21.3	21.0	21.6	Slightly above threshold 👍
5	20.9	21.1	20.5	21.3	Big overlap around threshold ⚠️

Let’s take delta = 0.5 dB (the safety margin).

⸻

🧱 Common interpretation rules

Symbol	Meaning
L \ge T + \delta	Band entirely above threshold → confident feasible (class 1)
U \le T - \delta	Band entirely below threshold → confident infeasible (class 0)
L \le T \le U	Band crosses threshold → ambiguous region


⸻

1️⃣ Safety-First Policy

“Never risk a QoT failure.”

Rule:
	•	class 1 only if L \ge T + \delta
	•	class 0 otherwise (including any overlap)

Sample	L	U	Decision	Reason
1	22.4	23.0	1	L = 22.4 ≥ 21.5 → safe above
2	20.6	21.2	0	Band crosses 21 → uncertain → conservative
3	19.3	19.9	0	Entirely below
4	21.0	21.6	0	L = 21 < 21.5 → overlap → 0
5	20.5	21.3	0	Overlap → 0

✅ Guarantees no false positives, but may block feasible paths (pessimistic).

⸻

2️⃣ Balanced Policy

“Allow feasible decision if most of the band is above the threshold.”

Extra quantities:
\phi_\text{above} = \frac{\max(0,U-T)}{U-L}.

Let’s set p_{\min}=0.7.

Sample	L	U	ϕₐᵦₒᵥₑ	Decision	Reason
1	22.4	23.0	1.00	1	Entirely above
2	20.6	21.2	(21.2−21)/(21.2−20.6)=0.33	0	Only 33 % above
3	19.3	19.9	0.00	0	Below
4	21.0	21.6	(21.6−21)/0.6=1.00	1	Mostly above & close
5	20.5	21.3	(21.3−21)/0.8=0.375	0	Only 37 % above

✅ Keeps safety but recovers clear near-threshold successes.

⸻

3️⃣ Optimistic Policy

“If any part above threshold → assume it will work.”

Rule:
	•	class 1 if U ≥ T
	•	class 0 otherwise.

Sample	L	U	Decision	Reason
1	22.4	23.0	1	Fully above
2	20.6	21.2	1	Upper > 21 → maybe feasible
3	19.3	19.9	0	Entirely below
4	21.0	21.6	1	Above
5	20.5	21.3	1	Slightly above

✅ Maximizes capacity (high throughput).
❌ Risk: many false positives → potential QoT violations.

⸻

4️⃣ Abstain (Three-way) Policy

“Admit only confident 0/1; abstain otherwise.”

Rule:
	•	class 1 if L \ge T+\delta
	•	class 0 if U \le T-\delta
	•	otherwise abstain (−1)

Sample	L	U	Decision	Reason
1	22.4	23.0	1	Confident above
2	20.6	21.2	−1	Overlaps
3	19.3	19.9	0	Below
4	21.0	21.6	−1	Overlaps
5	20.5	21.3	−1	Overlaps

✅ Explicitly signals “uncertain → pick lower modulation or measure again”.

📊 Summary Comparison

Sample	True OSNR	Safety-First	Balanced	Optimistic	Abstain
1	22.5	1	1	1	1
2	20.5	0	0	1	−1
3	19.5	0	0	0	0
4	21.1	0	1	1	−1
5	20.9	0	0	1	−1

🔍 Interpretation in Optical QoT terms

Policy	Network behavior	Risk type
Safety-First	Strongly pessimistic → avoids any QoT failure but wastes capacity.	
Balanced	Calibrated → uses uncertainty to admit safe margins; practical for deployment.	
Optimistic	Aggressive / optimistic → pushes throughput, risk of outages (QoT failures).	
Abstain	Hybrid → adds “request verification or downgrade” region for ambiguous bands.

If you’d like, I can extend this example with a confusion matrix for each policy using random ground truth (based on the true OSNR ≥ 21 rule), so you can see TP/TN/FP/FN percentages side-by-side. Would you like me to show that next?
